NOTE: original means that test uses the original network structure that DeepMind used

00_walkway_original:
  * Train on 100 unit long snaking walkway with original 7 actions, bad results
  * Path type: winding
  * Path length: 100 units
  * Number of actions: 7 (no-op, forward, backward, rotate-up, rotate-down, rotate-left, rotate-right)
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: NO
  
01_walkway_original:
  * Tried with 10 unit straight walkway
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 7
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: NO
  
02_walkway_original_fixedz
  * I realized I was rewarding for going in the wrong direction. Going away is negative z.
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 7
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: NO
  
03_walkway_original_3acts
  * Retested previous setup with only 3 actions for simplicity (no-op, forward, backward).
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 3 (no-op, forward, backward)
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: NO
  
04_walkway_original_static_input:
  * Tried feeding a single walkway pic to ensure passing in images was not the issue
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 3
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: NO
  
05_walkway_original_static_input_immediate_act:
  * Realized that the Player.performAction method was setting the action but not updating the game state before evaluating the result
  * Tested giving a reward based on whether the action specified moving forward or not instead of whether the player had moved by that time.
  * Still used a static frame as input
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 3
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: YES
  
06_walkway_original_live_input_immediate_act:
  * Re-added images from the game instead of a static frame
  * Everything else was the same as the previous 
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 3
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: YES
  
07_walkway_original_live_input_fixed_update:
  * Same as previous but re-organized code to apply the action before evaluating the reward
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 3
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: YES

08_walkway_original_live_input_fixed_update_full_acts:
  * Same as previous but re-added original 7 actions
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 7
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: YES
  
09_walkway_original_live_input_fixed_update_full_acts_100length:
  * Same as previous but increased straight walkway length to 100 units
  * Path type: straight
  * Path length: 10 units
  * Number of actions: 7
  * Network structure: Original DeepMind
  * Successful: YES
